          What Do Companies Do With Your Data?

          <p>There are several ways that companies use the data that you have provided.
          </p>
          <h3>Improve Customer Experience</h3>
          <p>Most companies use user data as a way to better understand their customers, in hopes of improving their engagement with the company, whether it be reviews or feedback. By reviewing customer experiences, they can adjust their products or services to cater to the general population.</p>
          <p>An example might be app developers where based on user data, they would identify which features users would use the most and focus on improving them, or e-commerce platforms such as Samsung, which would produce products, and then track customer reviews to address complaints.
          </p>
          <h3>Sell your Data to third parties</h3>
          <p>It is quite common for companies nowadays to sell your data to others, and these are known as Data Brokers. Data brokers buy, analyze and store your data, and companies that collect mass amounts of information are their best friends. It’s a win-win situation for both, but a loss for you and other consumers. The companies will receive large amounts of profit, the data brokers will have lots of information, and it is you, that is losing out; having your personal information sold without knowing.
          </p>
          <h3>To personalize your advertisements</h3>
          <p>Ever notice that when you have finished browsing shopping platforms such as Amazon, Bestbuy, or just any other large e-commerce site, you see their advertisements on other unrelated websites about products similar to what you were just looking at but trying to entice you with their discounts? This is part of what companies, especially e-commerce organizations do with your data and is not a coincidence. </p>
          <p>This process is called retargeting. It’s a marketing tactic that uses ads to target people who have already visited your website in an attempt to entice them to go back to the original website and complete what they were doing, typically purchasing an item. An example of this might be looking on H&M for clothes without making a purchase. They can then retarget them on a different app or website, hence they will see the same product they were originally looking at on a completely different platform.</p>

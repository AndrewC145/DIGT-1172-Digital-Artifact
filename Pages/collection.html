          How Do Companies Collect Your Data?

        <div class="text-wrapper reveal">
          <p>Companies use sneaky tactics to gather mass amounts of user data. Although the service that you are using is “free”, it technically isn’t. You pay for their service by offering your time and data, hence the advertisements that you see about something you were looking at just a few minutes prior. These companies regularly capture and store large amounts of user information so they have an idea of who you are, ie. identification, and what they decide to do later on with it. </p>
          <p class="paragraph-collect">There are several kinds of information that companies collect:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Personal Data: This includes information that can identify you, such as name, gender, IP address, and device IDs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Usage/Engagement Data: How you interact with a website, mobile apps, email messages, ads, social media, and any other interactive elements.
              </li>
              <li>
                Behavioural Data: This includes things such as purchase history, how much time you’ve spent on the website, mouse movement and how you navigate across the website.
              </li>
              <li>
                Attitudinal data: This data type is a bit different, but it typically relates to data on consumer satisfaction, and what influences them to become more likely to purchase a specific product .
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>But how do they do this? Companies can collect data in several ways, some very technical and others a bit more obvious. Customer data can be collected by directly asking customers and by indirectly tracking them.
          </p>
          <p>Businesses are always trying to collect your data from all sorts of places on their website. The most obvious ones are consumer activity on their websites and social media pages through phone calls and live chats, but another one is also cookies. Ever notice that whenever you visit a website, they always prompt you to accept all cookies? That is easy for companies to collect small details about you since one click is all it takes to make that popup disappear, but when you get into the small details by asking to “configure” your choices, you can actually see what you’re being a target of, such as “functional”, “strictly necessary” and “advertising” cookies they say.</p>
          <p>Another way companies collect your data is by using something called location-based advertising, where they use tracking technologies to build a profile tailored to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Companies do more than collect your information for their business, it has become common for many of them to start selling your information to third parties for just pennies on the marketplace, for the information you thought was only available to the company you visited, but instead is handed out to anyone willing to pay the tiny fee.
